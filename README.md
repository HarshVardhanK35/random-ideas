# Random Ideas Application

1. **Backend***
- where we have routes that we can hit with HTTP requests to create, read, update and delete ideas
2. **Frontend**
- we used webpack, we used modules and UI components.

*Note*:
* we did not implement the authentication but we implemented a mimic of authentication using usernames that we gonna store them in local storage.
* we can only delete the ideas associated with our username but not with other usernames.
(it is not true authentication but it mimics how authentication actually works)

**Tools Used:**
1. *Express*- Backend web framework for NodeJS
  (easy to create routes and we gonna create data models for our ideas, a model and a schema)
2. *Postman*- make requests
  (POST- add an idea; PUT- to update; DELETE- to delete)
3. *MongoDB*(NoSQL data base)- create a mongodb database on the cloud with tool- ATLAS
4. *Mongoose*- To use database within our application we use this tool
  (make queries using simple methods like- find, findById findAndUpdate)


**Conclusion**:
* created a full-stack application with
 -> back-end using express and mongoDb.
 -> front-end is just vanilla JS using module bundler, webpack
* we have not used framework but used UI components and services for our API

**NOTE**:
